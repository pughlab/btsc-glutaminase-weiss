## Data Availability

Single cell RNA-sequencing datasets used in this study were obtained from [Richards LM et al., Nature Cancer, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-020-00154-9). Raw sequencing data is available through the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGAS00001004656; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/) repository. Processed single cell RNA-sequencing data are publically available through the Broad Institute Single-Cell Portal (https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1155).
